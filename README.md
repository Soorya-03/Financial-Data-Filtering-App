Financial Data Filtering App

This project works with a flask backend, and a react frontend.

The repository has two folders, named backend and frontend. You need to have two terminals in these directories and running the files for the program to work. <br/>
Setting up Backend:<br/>
First, you need to have the required dependencies for it to work. make sure you have python and pip installed.<br/>
If you have pip installed, you can run the following commands to install the dependencies.<br/>
Commands on windows:<br/>
pip install requests <br/>
pip install flask <br/>
pip install flask-cors <br/>
Commands on mac: <br/>
python3 -m pip install requests <br/>
python3 -m pip install flask <br/>
python3 -m pip install flask-cors<br/>

With these dependencies installed, you can run the backend with python .\Server.py. <br/>

If you get this message, "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000" it means the back end is set up correctly and is running. <br/>

 Setting up Frontend:<br/>
 For Vite to work, you need to have Node.js 14.18 or newer, so update or reinstall Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en <br/>
 Thanks to npm, just just make sure you have navigated to the frontend folder and type npm install in your terminal. This will install the required dependencies for you.

<br/>
Once the dependencies are installed, you run the frontend with  npm run dev.
you can then navigate to the website with the url given in the terminal.
<br/>
You can access the app via the frontend with the url given after running npm run dev.
Note: you need to have both the frontend and the backend running on two different terminals for the app to work.
